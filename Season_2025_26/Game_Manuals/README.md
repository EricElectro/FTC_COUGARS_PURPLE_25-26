## Recommended Reading Plan for New Team Members

1. Read **Game Details** (how to score)
2. Read **Game Rules** (how not to get penalties)
3. Scan **ROBOT Construction Rules** before designing anything
4. During competition week - review **ARENA** and **Event Rules**

**We do not build or compete first —  
We understand the game first.**
